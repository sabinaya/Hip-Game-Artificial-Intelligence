"""
We use a [9][9] matrix to indicate the board of the Hip game.
0 - it is empty
1 - Blue
2 - Red

There are 2 approaches to this
1. Is either all the given boxes are predefined and stored.
No matter which inclination and position.
2. Else we have function which takes the current input of the board and
predicts whether a square is possible or not

At any point of time as soon as a square is formed by either R or B, that person loses and the game terminates.
"""

"""
First attempt to solve the problem 
All the input will be given by the human itself.
There will no human vs computer.

"""
In this program we are taking input states of different board configuration.
